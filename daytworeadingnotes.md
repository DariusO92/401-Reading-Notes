# Loops

-  Overview
In this article, we'll look at a core aspect of the Java language – executing a statement or a group of statements repeatedly – using loops.

- Intro to Loops
In programming languages, looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

Here are the types of loops that we can find in Java:

Simple for loop
Enhanced for-each loop
While loop
Do-While loop

- For Loop
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

- While Loop
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

- Do-While Loop
The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: Java Do-While Loop.
